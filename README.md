# Guitar LA Shopping Cart

## Description and Motivation

- A simple shopping cart project for practicing TypeScript and improve my coding skills using React.js, context API and CSS3. On these shopping cart you can see a list of guitars on the main view and select the ones who you want to buy, you can add a max of five units of each item, you can decrease or increase quantity, remove items and clear the shopping cart.

- I used React.js for it simplicity and component oriented capabilities with TypeScript to avoid type-related errors at compile time and ship a secured code, and Context API for sharing a single source of state through nearby components.
